## How To Play

ENIGMA gameplay, players try to crack the ENIGMA code randomly chosen by the computer. Players are given hints generated by the computer after every attempt to try to logically deduce what the correct secret code is.  

* The ENIGMA code is 4 unique numbers between 1 - 8.

* The player has 10 attempts to guess the secret code.  The correct guess must be all 4 correct numbers in the correct order.

* After every attempt (unless you guess the ENIGMA code) the player is given a code hint. GREEN represents how many numbers were correct and in the correct position. YELLOW represents how many numbers were correct but not in the incorrect position & RED represents how many numbers are not in the ENIGMA code at all.  

* The ENIGMA hints of GREEN, YELLOW & RED do not match the order of the player's numbers in their guess to make the game more challenging.

>
>**For example:**
>
>       ENIGMA code is 1234
>
>       guess is: 1356
>
>       ENIGMA hint will be: RED RED GREEN YELLOW
>
>       This represents 1 is GREEN and 3 is YELLOW and 5 & 6 are RED
