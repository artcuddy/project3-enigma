## How To Play

In ENIGMA, users play to crack the secret code randomly chosen by the computer.  Users are given hints generated by the computer after every attempt to try to logically deduce what the correct secret code is.  

*   The secret code is 4 unique numbers between 1 - 9.

* The player has 10 attempts to guess the secret code.  The correct guess must be all 4 correct numbers in the correct order.

* After every attempt (unless successful) the player is given a code hint.  REEN represents how many numbers were correct and in the correct position.  YELLOW represents how many numbers were correct but in the incorrect position & RED represents how many numbers are not in the ENIGMA code.  

* The code hint of GREENs and YELLOW do not match the order of the player's numbers in their guess to make the game more challenging.

>
>**For example:**
>
>       ENIGMA code is 1234
>
>       guess is: 1356
>
>       ENIGMA hint will be: RED RED GREEN YELLOW
>
>       This represents 1 is GREEN and 3 is YELLOW and 5 & 6 are RED
