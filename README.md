ENIGMA - Code Breaking Game, is a Python terminal game that runs on Heroku.

This game is losely based on the board game of [Mastermind]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

### Demo
A live version of the game can be found <a href="https://enigma-code-breaker.herokuapp.com/">**HERE**</a><br><br>

## How To Play

ENIGMA gameplay, players try to crack the ENIGMA code randomly chosen by the computer. Players are given hints generated by the computer after every attempt to try to logically deduce what the correct secret code is.  

* The ENIGMA code is 4 unique numbers between 1 - 8.

* The player has 10 attempts to guess the secret code.  The correct guess must be all 4 correct numbers in the correct order.

* After every attempt (unless you guess the ENIGMA code) the player is given a code hint. GREEN represents how many numbers were correct and in the correct position. YELLOW represents how many numbers were correct but not in the incorrect position & RED represents how many numbers are not in the ENIGMA code at all.  

* The ENIGMA hints of GREEN, YELLOW & RED do not match the order of the player's numbers in their guess to make the game more challenging.

>
>**For example:**
>
>       ENIGMA code is 1234
>
>       guess is: 1356
>
>       ENIGMA hint will be: RED RED GREEN YELLOW
>
>       This represents 1 is GREEN and 3 is YELLOW and 5 & 6 are RED

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

**Title Section:**

* [Pyfiglet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-ascii-art-using-pyfiglet-module/#:~:text=pyfiglet%20takes%20ASCII%20text%20and,pyfiglet%20module%20%3A%20pip%20install%20pyfiglet) was installed and import pyfiglet was used to generate ASCII art for the title and subtitle of the game.

* The Figlet font banner3-D was used for the title of the game 

* For the subtitle the Figlet font used was digital.

* Text is run from left to right over the screen with the message "Guess all 4 numbers to crack the ENIGMA code!" utilising [sys-stdout](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sys-stdout-write-in-python/) and sleep to printout the letters as if it was a type writer.

**Username Input Section:**

* A message to the user to enter their name is seen first. This alerts the user on how to start playing the game.

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-name-screen.png"><br><br>

* If the user enters a blank space or enters only numbers as the username an error will be shown with info on the error

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-blank-username.png"><br><br>

* After the user enters a correct username this is returned in green with a welcome message

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-name-screen.png"><br><br>

**Game Help Section:**

* The user is then presented with 2 options, view the help screen by entering H or play game by entering P

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-play-help-screen.png"><br><br>

* If anything is entered except P or H an error will be displayed to the user

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-help-error-screen.png"><br><br>

* If H is entered the help screen comes in view explaining how to play the ENIGMA game

* At the bottom of this screen there are 2 options, enter P to play the game or X to exit the help screen

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-help-screen.png"><br><br>

**Game Play Section:**

* If P is entered the ENIGMA game will start with the initial player guess request printed to the terminal

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-initial-game-screen.png"><br><br>

* Once the player has entered a vaild guess the code is evaulated against the ENIGMA code to see if any of the numbers match

* If any of the numbers match a hint will be shown to the user to indicate if it's either in the ENIGMA code and if it's in the correct postion by using the colour codes<br><br>
GREEN: One of the numbers is in the ENIGMA code and in the correct position<br><br>
YELLOW: One of the numbers is in the ENIGMA code but is not in the correct position<br><br>
RED: One of the numbers is not in the ENIGMA code at all<br><br>

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-code-hint.png"><br><br>

* If the user enters a blank space or a letters as the guess an error will be shown explaining why it's not a vaild guess 

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-letters-error.png"><br><br>

* If the user enters more than 4 numbers as the guess an error will be shown explaining why it's not a vaild guess 

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-to-many-numbers-error.png"><br><br>

* If the user is good enough to crack the ENIGMA code you will be presented with the WIN screen 

* At the bottom of the screen there is an option to play a new game by entering Y or exit the game by entering N

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-win-screen.png"><br><br>

* If the users attempts reach 0 then the  lose screen will be presented and the ENGIMA code will be revealed

* At the bottom of the screen there is an option to play a new game by entering Y or exit the game by entering N

<img src="assets/screenshots/enigma-lose-screen.png"><br><br>

* Should the user select to exit the game a goodbye message is displayed and the game is quit

<h2 id="testing">Development & Testing</h2>

**Flow Chart**
<br><br>
To design the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls were executed or evaluated a flow chart was used for the control flow. Here, the flow of the game was laid out and structured to aid in the design of the control flow statements such as if-elif-else statements, while loops and for loops. This also allowed the design of the user input validation checks to be visually clear before the code was written.

<img src="assets/flowchart/enigma-flow-chart.png"><br><br>

**Testing**

*   Methods such as print() as the code developed was used to check for errors.  This helped check everything was behaving as expected and functions such as generating the random numbers for the ENIGMA code were being generated correctly.  

*   Any testing user inputs were printed back to the console to check all functions and methods were correctly applied to the input.  

*   Errors or warnings were fixed as they appeared such as indentation errors, lines too long or extra space issues.  This helped keep the code clean and readable so other errors or bugs that arose were identified more easily.

*   After deployment all features were checked on a laptop, mobile (iPhone 13). The site was sent to peers to check from their devices that all features functioned correctly and feedback on functionality was positive across all devices checked such as PC, Laptop, Tablets and Mobiles (Android & IOS). The website was checked on Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

*   The game was deployed early on in development and checked regularly to ensure game flow and any errors were handled early on.

*   Testing inputs were used to ensure user inputs would be handled correctly and appropriate feedback to the user was shown on screen. As mentioned above in the Features Section for how user inputs were handled.

    *   User Name:
    As this will accept anything but nothing entered, the enter key was pressed to ensure error was caught and handled appropriately.

    *   Player Choice:
    To test capital and small R and P were typed in and also other random inputs such as spaces, other letters, words or numbers to ensure error caught and handled appropriately.

    *   Player Guess:
    As this will only accept 4 numbers between 1-8 separated by a space, many other combinations of input were tested.  For example, more or fewer numbers were entered, numbers less than 1 or greater than 8 were entered.  Numbers without spaces or extra spaces and also random special characters and no entry at all were all tested to ensure errors were caught and handled appropriately.

    *   ENIGMA Code Hint:
    The ENIGMA code was printed to the terminal during development to help with testing the code hint generated matched the player's guesses.  It was checked to ensure numbers in the correct position generated a GREEN hint, numbers in incorrect position generated a YELLOW hint and numbers not in the ENIGMA code at all generated a RED hint.

    *   Attempts Left:
    Attempts left was checked by playing the game through to see if guesses left decreased by 1 each time and also that guesses left did not change if an input error was entered.

    *   Game Won / Game Lost
    The game was tested on winning and losing to ensure the correct messages were displayed for both.

    * Play Again
    As mentioned above in the Features section.  To play again the user can type Y or N.  This was tested for lower and uppercase Y and N to check both worked.  Other inputs such as numbers, random words or letters and the enter key pressed were all checked to ensure the errors were handled correctly and appropriate feedback to the user was given.

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

The project was deployed via [Heroku]( https://id.heroku.com/login), and the live link can be found here: [ENIGMA – Code Breaker](https://enigma-code-breaker.herokuapp.com/) 

This project was developed utilising the [Code Institute Template]( https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template).  Some of the deployment steps below are specifically required for the new CI template and may not be applicable to older versions, or different projects.

Before deploying to Heroku pip3 freeze > requirements.txt was used to add pyfiglet and termcolor imports for deployment.

This project was deployed to Heroku using the Heroku CLI details below

* Login
To use the CLI you must log in to your Heroku account. To do this you will need to
enter the command heroku login -i in the terminal. It requires the email and
password you used to sign up. If you have enabled multi-factor authentication (a
recommended security practice) then instead of your password you need an API key.
To get the API key go to your account settings and scroll down to the section ‘API
Key’. Click reveal and copy that, then paste it into the password prompt.

<img src="assets/screenshots/heroku-login-cli.jpg"><br><br>

* Creating A Heroku App
Now that you are logged in, the first thing is to create a new app. Heroku creates a
URL based on your app name, so it must be unique not only on your account, but
across the whole site. You may need to try a few different names. To create an app
use the following command, where myapp is the name of your app.

<img src="assets/screenshots/creating-heroku-app.jpg"><br><br>

* Here the app heroku-cli-example has been created with an output of the website
URL. It also displays and sets the git remote repository which will be used to deploy.
By default the region will be set to the US. If you would prefer a server based in the
EU then you can specify the region with the flag EU

* Packages
* When you push code to Heroku it will look at the repository contents to decide how
to build the project. One of the factors taken into consideration is the package file.
With a Python project the standard file is a requirements.txt file, which will have the
list of packages needed to run the project. If this file is present it will build the project
using the Python buildpack.
<br><br>
* It is also possible to specify the buildpack manually. For the projects covered in the
course this is unnecessary but useful to know for the future. More information about
buildpacks can be found in the documentation. To check the buildpack for the
project you can enter heroku buildpacks in the terminal.


* Click either **Enable Automatic Deploys** for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github.

* Select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click **Deploy Branch** for manual deployment.
